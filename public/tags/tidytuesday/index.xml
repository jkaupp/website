      <description>I do not update this site as much as I would like. Interacting through twitter and the #R4DS slack channel has been my main contributions as of late to being more active in the #rstats community. I make plans to get to things like posting, then end up with other work, a neat idea, or just decide spend time with my family.
Worthy endeavors all of them.
Anyways, Thomas Mock (@thomasmock), has started up #tidytuesday out of the mentorship pilot program in #R4DS.</description>
