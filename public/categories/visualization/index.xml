      <description>I’ve been having some days! Between sick kids, myself getting sick, deadlines and development promises, I haven’t had a lot of time to make any kind of blog post. I have been following along with my #tidytuesday analysis and visualization though, so this week you get a double feature!
First up is last weeks Australian tax data. It was interesting to see other approaches to visualizations and what people presented, and a lot of people represented the data as straight up job salary and the inequity between men and women.</description>

      <description>This weeks #TidyTuesday is all about global mortality rates. I’ve looked at datasets like this before, and while they are a great way to see interesting trends and practise some visualization skills, I think there is another lesson to be learned. The human element of data.
These data were people.
They meant something to someone. They were here, now they are not. I think its important to think about the context of the data in that aspect, and realize that any analysis conducted should be done with that firmly in mind.</description>

      <description>I do not update this site as much as I would like. Interacting through twitter and the #R4DS slack channel has been my main contributions as of late to being more active in the #rstats community. I make plans to get to things like posting, then end up with other work, a neat idea, or just decide spend time with my family.
Worthy endeavors all of them.
Anyways, Thomas Mock (@thomasmock), has started up #tidytuesday out of the mentorship pilot program in #R4DS.</description>

      <description>The strength of R doesn’t lie in a single programming paradigm, it lies within the warm, welcoming and ecclectic community of useRs.
 Like anyone who gets introduced to R, you start to look on the web for other like minded people. Upon doing so, you find a vibrant community with very knowledgeable and helpful people. Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr) is one of those people, doling out R wisdom, visualization, typography, culinary and infosec goodness on the regular.</description>
