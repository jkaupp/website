      <description>I do not update this site as much as I would like. Interacting through twitter and the #R4DS slack channel has been my main contributions as of late to being more active in the #rstats community. I make plans to get to things like posting, then end up with other work, a neat idea, or just decide spend time with my family.
Worthy endeavors all of them.
Anyways, Thomas Mock (@thomasmock), has started up #tidytuesday out of the mentorship pilot program in #R4DS.</description>

      <description>The strength of R doesnâ€™t lie in a single programming paradigm, it lies within the warm, welcoming and ecclectic community of useRs.
 Like anyone who gets introduced to R, you start to look on the web for other like minded people. Upon doing so, you find a vibrant community with very knowledgeable and helpful people. Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr) is one of those people, doling out R wisdom, visualization, typography, culinary and infosec goodness on the regular.</description>
