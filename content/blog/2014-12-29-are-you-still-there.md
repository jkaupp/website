Sometimes a simple pause leads to a time-out.   Juggling parenthood, my normal hatrack of jobs, plus teaching put way to many demands on my time to devote it to #dalmooc, despite it being a very interesting experience.  I kept up viewing some hangouts and videos when I could, but didn't devote any effort to the assignments and community experience.  So for all of my lofty goals, I fell very short in the application/implementation of them.

Hopefully things will be better with my next efforts for the Indiana University Information Visualization MOOC (IVMOOC). Without a teaching load for this semester, alongside a more traditional, transmission style MOOC, it should be easier.

Fingers crossed, and looking forward to getting some new ideas to make these blocks of data sing.
