I'm liking this course.  The videos are easy to listen to and are in nice manageable chunks that I can watch them while making dinner, or on a quick break from work.  I especially liked the discussion of the burst-detection model this week, although I would have enjoyed a more in-depth discussion on how the model works.  I'm filing that for future research and reading once I get the opportunity to explore the textbook and associated papers.  The hands on videos this week were fantastic, and offered a great tutorial to accomplish this analysis in Sci2.  Below is my temporal bar graph/burst analysis of Mesothelioma, stopping at the year 2007.  I might redo it, given some time, as I'm concerned about the generated scale being a bit wonky (two entries for zero?).

I do wonder about the self-assessments.  They seem to be stand-alone things for people to check if they've absorbed key facts/nuggets of information from the videos.  That to me seems far less important than being able to discuss what each approach can be used for, what its benefits are, and how this would be applied in actual practise.  The assignments reflect this to a degree, and the client project whole-heartedly embraces this. But I wonder about the midterm/final  being a test to see if we've absorbed the discrete bits of content, which worries me.  Content is important, but developing the skills to conduct visual analysis and create useful and meaningful visualizations of data seems to be a goal of the course.

I think the midterm/final would be a perfect case for authentic assessment of the skills/techniques presented in the course thus far.  It would require both a knowledge of the content, plus the practise of skills and techniques presented thus far.  I'm crossing my fingers for this, and hoping I'm pleasantly surprised.  I have my doubts though, as the grading scheme and expectations for the course have been not communicated to the participants, or at the least, very difficult to find.

Either way, it's something I can overlook as I believe the opportunity to explore this kind of content in a guided fashion far outweighs my concerns about assessment!
