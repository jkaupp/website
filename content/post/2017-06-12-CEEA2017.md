Yes, I get it. I don't post often enough.  I think I'm going to change that though, and overhaul things around here, for a few reasons.

1. Better place to showcase my own work
2. A place for professional reflection
3. Interaction with the rstats and visualization communities
4. Personal portfolio 

Since I was last here my kids have grown (!), my wife and I continue on the parenting journey (whee!), I launched my consulting career (Woo!), had an interview for a teaching-focused faculty position (unsuccessful), started working more on building the local R community (Yay!), working with the software carpentry to promote reseach computing (oooh!), and put a LOT of development time into miscellaneous projects at work (visualization, applications and data infrastructure).  I put a great deal of time into developing and organizing my R code into a number of libraries to help me work more efficiently.

I don't think their anything worthy outside of Queen's, but they are a way to offer other interested parties the ability to use what I've built for their own purpose.

As part of continuing to develop professionally, I was successful on a bid for a Visualization workshop for the Canadian Engineering Education Assocation's Annual Conference.  The conference happened just last week (June 4th to June 7th) in Toronto, Ontario.  I love attending CEEA, partly because it's the ONLY Canadian conference in my research interests (Engineering Education) and partly because of the amazing people you meet there.

I have never had a bad time at CEEA.  If you're reading this, and interested in Engineering Education come to the next meeting in sunny Vancouver (UBC is hosting!).

My workshop was on the fundamentals of data visualization.  I focused on a split lecture/activity format going over the principles of effective visualization (blending Tufte, Cleveland, Bertin, Few and Kirkland with Cairo, Camoes, Borner, Evergreen and Kosara).  This was for engineers, so they innately understand apects of design, and a user-centered approach and are quite technically literate (or at least excel literate).   What I wanted to provide for them were the elements of theory and practise that they are blissfully unaware of: to be able to give them some guidelines, some theory and a workflow for creating their own visualization.

I was happy with how everything came together, but the hypercritical part of me sees many areas for improvement.  There was a lot of interest, I had a full room well over the 40 people registration limit and actually ran out of my 2-page guides.  Thankfully I did put everything into [a github repo](https://github.com/jkaupp/CEEA2017-Speaking-With-Data) which contains the PDF slides and the 2-page guide from my talk.   I had a lot of people come up and speak with me after about my work, and made a lot of fantastic contacts around the visualization of formative assessment data to better engage and support student learning.

The rest of the conference was great.  We had a good turnout at the EGAD workshop later in the day, a fantastic reception dinner, which kicked off a great conference.  Two great keynote speakers, lots of great lightning talks, fantastic conversations around engineering education, outcomes assessment and continuous improvement.  Fantastic food, dinner at Casa Loma, and a more consultation and transparency from the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. 

Looking forward to next year!
