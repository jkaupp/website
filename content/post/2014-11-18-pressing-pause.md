Dear #Dalmooc,

Unfortunately, I have to press pause for some time on my learning to tackle deadlines, wrap up teaching and evaluate my students and my teaching. Â Hopefully I'll be able to catch up before the deadlines for the early competencies.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled program, already in progress.
