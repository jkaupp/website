I'd like to consider myself as a self-directed, life-long learner. Rather, I would now after undergrad, grad school with a plethora of job related learning thrown in.  I didn't start that way, I had to learn.  I had to create my own meaning, develop the regulation, control my own motivation, deal with my own setbacks, reflect on my learning, reflect on my behaviour.  Essentially scale the summit of bloom's taxonomy, and make my way through liminality until I found the golden lightbulb of a transformative experience. (I now win the bet of educational jargon laced into metaphor).
I see this paralleled with [LINK5.10x] Data, Analytics, and Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/utarlingtonx/utarlingtonx-link5-10x-data-analytics-2186) or #DALMOOC, or at least in the comments of the other learners.

It's structured in a self-deterministic, "choose your own adventure" manner of learning, with a heavy dose of social and community learning.  So far it's a place of high-minded concepts, discussion, a variety of technology, and a lot of social interaction.  Notice that 'directions' or 'scaffolding' weren't mentioned.  In the early going, it's leaving a lot up to us.  Explore, poke around, get comfortable with things on your own terms, set learning goals, plan your learning out yourself, have some fun, and interact with other people!  This is great if you have the ability to find comfort in chaos, or the ability to deal with uncertainty in your learning.

It's not so great if you've never had an experience like this before, as it can be disorienting, confusing and down right scary. Most learners may be only used to more traditional learning can quickly become disengaged, disillusioned and sometimes hostile to such experiences.  This is where a learner faces a decision, either stick with it and ride out the experience hoping it will become clear soon, or disengage and leave the course.  The instructors may hope that these learners may turn to the community first, find a kindred spirit facing the same problem and through shared experiences, stick with the course and make it through.

This is a great notion.  However, it's usually not something that can happen on it's own.  Learning communities need to be fostered and developed, which is difficult to do when you don't have a physical classroom or the ability to see your learners.  The instructors are doing what they can, by having regular virtual contact through hangouts, twitter and other technologies and embarking on a bit of lecture and storytelling.  But they can only do so much.

This is where the rest of the community comes in.  We need to reach out to those in need, and support their learning by being visible and offering help when help is needed.  Those struggling have a responsibility too.  Engage with the community, talk to people on twitter, use the forums, engage on Prosolo. (if anyone can adjust the timeout window on prosolo, please do so.)

So far it's a neat experience, and a neat experiment (research questions on so many levels and meta-levels).  It's got me thinking about the needs and goals of other people, thinking about values and worth, making me aware of my own learning goals, and fostering a sense of engagement. Affectively effective!
