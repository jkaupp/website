*This post is addressing the first assignment/question for #DALMOOC*

Analytics use at this organization is largely focused on academic analytics, using the results of assessment of student learning to inform course, program and curriculum improvements.  It is less of a strategic framework put forward by the institution and more of one mandated by an accrediting body for individual programs, which leaves it up to the purview of the faculty.  The collection of data has been ongoing for years, and is rolling out to a wider scale in the years to come.  This brings with it considerable questions regarding the capacity to analyze the data in an effective fashion, disseminate those results broadly and quickly to all stakeholders and then provide actionable improvements as a result.

The largest barriers for the current efforts lie with resources and buy-in.  While there are resources available for certain aspects of an data analyst/scientist position, this is largely a grassroots effort in the early stages of development and hasn't demonstrated the usefulness required to attract more resources.  Given time, this will change.  The other barrier is getting the support of departments to develop their processes to collect quality data and evidence of student learning.  They are new to the aspect of using data to enact improvements, especially since this may include some aspects of altering their teaching approach to improve learning, rather than come up with diverse ways to present content.  It is this aspect of enacting a change, culture or paradigm shift that is difficult.

First, they must be shown how the data can help them answer their own fundamental questions regarding student learning. That has required some preliminary work to show them the types of questions that can be answered from the preliminary data that has been collected, and how much power and utility exists by refining the process to capture higher quality and sufficiently granular data of student learning.

Just a small snapshot of my neighborhood.  Starting small, and getting better all the time.
