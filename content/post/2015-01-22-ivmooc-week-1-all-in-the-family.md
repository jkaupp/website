So I've made it through the first week of #IVMOOC. Gold stars all around!
I did learn some new things, new tricks and new tools from the lectures and I'm a sucker for a good framework.  Anything that can help me organize chaos in a logical, well though out manner appeals to the engineer in me. As an avid R and RStudio user, I love the SCI2 tool, and how it melds data wrangling aspects with the visualizations.  I did have some issues with the mac version of the tool, with some settings in GUESS not working correctly.

After realizing that it was using python, that made things a lot easier and just whipped up a quick script to do what I wanted it to do.

{% highlight python %}
resizeLinear(wealth,5,20)
colorize(priorates,"198,219,239","8,69,148";)
for n in g.nodes:
    n.labelvisible = true
    n.strokecolor = n.color
for e in g.edges:
    e.labelvisible = false
    e.width = 1
    if (e.business==";T"; and e.marriage==";T";):
        e.color=";102,194,165";
    if (e.business==";T"; and e.marriage==";F";):
        e.color=";252,141,98";
    if (e.business==";F"; and e.marriage==";T";):
        e.color=";141,160,203";
{% endhighlight %}

That lead me to the basic visualization, that I quickly pulled into [Affinity Designer](http://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/), my vector art and design instrument of choice, and made this:

This was a lot of fun to play around with, and dust off some skills that I haven't used or applied in a while.  Looking forward to the rest of the course, learning and interacting with everyone!
