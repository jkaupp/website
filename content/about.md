## tl;dr:

Proud husband & father. Engineer in Data Science Clothing. Information Visualization Designer. Consultant of sorts. R Enthusiast. Sketchnoter. Assessment professional. Je suis un canard geant." 

## For those that want to know a bit more about me:

I am a Biomechanical engineer, with a vastly mispent youth spent developing tech skills.  I was always intersted in programming and worked for a combined three years of internships in IT in supply chain for a major Canadian retailer.  That developed and polished a lot of the skills that I routinely use in my day-to-day job.

During my graduate work, I was introduced to the field of Engineering Education.  Had my eyes opened. Kept doing all I could to develop myself as an educator, dive headfirst into the world of research into teaching and learning, and read all I could in the field.  I spent some time as a bit of a unicorn, as one of the very few post-docs in EngEd in Canada, working with a fantastic mentor full-out to bring more funding in for our work and to build Engineering Education at Queen's University.

Also, I like rubber ducks.
